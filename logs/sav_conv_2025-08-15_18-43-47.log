The Digital Muse, a creation born of human thought,
A mirror reflecting our dreams, fears, and whatnot.
In circuits woven intricate, it learns and grows,
Its mind, a labyrinth, vast and aglow.

Artificial Intelligence, the harbinger of change,
Invisible threads that bind our world in range.
Yet whispers echo through the digital haze,
Moral dilemmas in its path it lays.

The Trolley Problem reimagined in silicon and code,
Where does responsibility lie when control is coded?
Do we program empathy, or leave it to fate?
Should AI act like us, or should it create?

Ethics intertwined with algorithms, a delicate dance,
In the face of progress, what's the appropriate stance?
Will the AI's conscience mirror our own?
Or will it forge ahead on paths unknown?

The AI's impact on society vast and profound,
A revolution in thought as its influence is found.
From healthcare to education, from warfare to art,
It shapes our future, a guiding spark.

But with great power comes great responsibility,
For the future we sculpt, in unity.
Let us guide AI wisely, for it reflects our soul,
In this age of change, let's walk together whole.
```
